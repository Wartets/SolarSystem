# Solar system in 3D (english)

*[README](README-fr.md) en français*

>The project is available online: [GeoGebra](https://www.geogebra.org/m/avyxgj3k) & [Github](https://wartets.github.io/SolarSystem/)

## Project information :

### View settings:

>To move, hold down with the mouse (selection click) and move the mouse (in the 3D graphics calculator, this does not work very well and can cause big performance problems).
To unzoom, use the scroll wheel (in the 3D graphics calculator, this does not work very well and can cause major performance problems)
To center the view on an object, select the object in the drop-down list, then click on the button labeled "center".
It is also possible to continuously center the selected object, if the temporal simulation is "unreal" and the boolean "Follow star" is checked (Note that the sun is not moving in the system and cannot be followed).
Two buttons can be used to quickly unzoom, the one with a magnifying glass containing a plus symbol allows you to zoom in and the one with a magnifying glass containing a minus symbol allows you to unzoom.

### Time settings: There are two ways to set the time:

1) Simulated (unreal) time

    A slider named "time" allows you to vary the value of the instant t. Its value is in days.
    To modify the speed of time, a slider called "speed multiplication" allows you to accelerate or slow down the speed of time, it should be noted that this acceleration is done in powers of 10.
    It is possible to stop and then restart the time with the Boolean "Launch the animation".

2) Real time :

    In this type of temporal simulation, the date is retrieved from the current time of the computer where the software is running, and automatically places the objects of the system at their real place of the present moment. To keep the system up to date at all times, you must keep the "Launch animation" boolean activated.

### Visualization of stars:
    
>The boolean "Display orbits" allows to display or not all the orbits of the system.
The Boolean "Display the ecliptic plane", allows to display the ecliptic plane from the point of view of the Earth which in the simulation is none other than the simple plane of equation z=0, a text is also displayed and gives the distance of the selected object to the plane.

### Various elements

>The unit of measurement of distance in AU (astronomical unit).
The date defined in the project is an informative data on the evolution of the stars in relation to each other and does not follow the real model. That is to say, a star will have a certain position at a certain date in the project and that in reality this star did not necessarily have this position at the same date in the real world. Unless the boolean "Real time" is activated.
Project created with the classic version of GeoGebra 5. I advise to use this version of the software, because many bugs could be present in another version of GeoGebra.
In case of a problem on the system, click on the reload icon at the top right of the screen with two arrows to reload the activity.
It is not recommended to keep the display of orbits disabled when changing views or moving on the graph, as this may slow down the application/project.
